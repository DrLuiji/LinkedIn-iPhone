LinkedIn API and Authentication for iPhoneOS


LinkedIn recently joined the growing number of social networking sites with public APIs. Since many
of our clients are professional organizations, it seemed natural to take advantage of that venue in
our applications, especially mobile ones. Since no one had build an Objective-C / iPhone client
library yet, we began work on our own.

This code is still in the early stages: it will allow your application to authenticate a user to the
API via OAuth, and to post status updates, but that's about it. Because we wanted to introduce as
few external dependencies as possible, this code manages its own HTTP connections, and does its own
XML parsing. As the API support becomes more complete, that's something we may need to revisit. (So
if anyone else uses this code, it would be useful to know what other libraries you're using.)


The demo application will require you to fill in your API and Secret keys from LinkedIn. Your
app should be designated as a mobile application, and the OAuth Redirect URL *must* be set to:
	http://linkedin_oauth/success



This work owes a debt of gratitude to Ben Gottlieb and his Twitter+OAuth code, which inspired
the authentication portion, and to Matt Gemmell's MGTwitterEngine for some ideas about how to
structure the API portion. Thanks for all your hard work, and making it Open Source!

Included in this project is Ben Gottlieb's snapshot of Kaboomerang's OAuthConsumer library from
Google Code, with his addition of an iPhone library project file, and the pin property on the
OAToken class. The original code can be found here:
